## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js for secure authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with secure cookies
- JWT tokens with expiration

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Database connection via SSL
- Environment variables for secrets

### Input Validation
- Zod schema validation on all inputs
- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- CSRF token validation

### Rate Limiting
- 60 requests per minute per IP (configurable)
- Automatic blocking of suspicious IPs
- DDoS protection via Cloudflare (production)

### Security Headers
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Monitoring & Logging
- Security event logging
- Failed authentication tracking
- Suspicious activity detection
- Error monitoring without exposing sensitive data

### Dependencies
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Only using trusted npm packages
- Lock file for reproducible builds

## Best Practices for Contributors
