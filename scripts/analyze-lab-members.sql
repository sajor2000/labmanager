-- LAB MEMBER ANALYSIS & CLEANUP SCRIPT
-- This script helps identify and remove fake/test lab members

-- 1. VIEW ALL LAB MEMBERS WITH HUMAN-READABLE INFORMATION
-- Shows each lab member with their user details and lab information

-- 2. IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS LAB MEMBERS (potential test/fake data)
-- ================================================================================

-- 3. STATISTICS BY LAB
-- ================================================================================

-- 4. MEMBERS IN TEST LAB (TRL) - SHOULD BE DELETED
-- ================================================================================

-- ================================================================================
-- 5. CLEANUP COMMANDS (UNCOMMENT TO RUN)
-- ================================================================================

-- Remove all members from TRL lab (if it exists)
-- DELETE FROM "LabMember" WHERE "labId" IN (SELECT id FROM "Lab" WHERE "shortName" = 'TRL');

-- Remove test user from all labs
-- DELETE FROM "LabMember" WHERE "userId" IN (SELECT id FROM "User" WHERE email = 'test@example.com');

-- Remove inactive lab memberships
-- DELETE FROM "LabMember" WHERE "isActive" = false;

-- Remove lab members for users with test emails
-- DELETE FROM "LabMember" WHERE "userId" IN (
--     SELECT id FROM "User" 
--     WHERE email LIKE '%test%' 
--        OR email LIKE '%demo%' 
--        OR email LIKE '%example%'
-- );

-- ================================================================================
-- 6. VERIFY CLEANUP RESULTS
-- ================================================================================
SELECT 
    'After cleanup:' as "Status",
    COUNT(*) as "Total Lab Members",
    COUNT(DISTINCT "labId") as "Unique Labs",
    COUNT(DISTINCT "userId") as "Unique Users"
