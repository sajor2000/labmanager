# Lab Filtering Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All pages now properly filter content based on the selected lab (RICCC or RHEDAS) using a global lab context.

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Global Lab Context** (`/lib/contexts/lab-context.tsx`)
- Created a React Context that manages the currently selected lab
- Persists lab selection in localStorage
- Dispatches custom events when lab changes
- Available throughout the entire application via the `useLab()` hook

### 2. **Lab Selector Component** (`/components/layout/lab-selector.tsx`)
- Dropdown in top navigation showing available labs
- Updates global context when user switches labs
- Shows current lab with checkmark indicator

### 3. **Pages Updated with Lab Filtering**

#### ✅ **Buckets Page** (`/app/buckets/page.tsx`)
- Fetches buckets filtered by `currentLab.id`
- Re-fetches when lab changes
- New buckets automatically assigned to current lab

#### ✅ **Studies Page** (`/app/studies/page.tsx` + `page-client.tsx`)
- Converted from server-side to client-side rendering
- Fetches projects/studies filtered by lab
- Updates when lab selection changes

#### ✅ **Ideas Page** (`/app/ideas/page.tsx`)
- Added lab context integration
- Fetches ideas filtered by `currentLab.id`
- Re-fetches on lab change

#### ✅ **Team Page** (`/app/team/page.tsx`)
- Fetches team members filtered by lab
- Shows only members associated with selected lab

#### ✅ **Standups Page** (`/app/standups/page.tsx`)
- Replaced local lab state with global context
- Fetches standups for selected lab
- Creates new standups with current lab ID

#### ✅ **Overview Dashboard** (`/app/overview/page.tsx` + `page-client.tsx`)
- Created client-side wrapper for dashboard
- Fetches metrics filtered by lab
- Shows lab-specific statistics

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **Lab Selection Flow:**
   ```
   User clicks lab selector → Updates context → Saves to localStorage → 
   Dispatches 'labChanged' event → All pages re-fetch data
   ```

2. **Data Filtering:**
   - All API endpoints support `?labId=xxx` query parameter
   - Each page passes `currentLab.id` when fetching data
   - Backend queries filter by lab ID

3. **Persistence:**
   - Selected lab saved in localStorage as `selectedLabId`
   - Restored on page refresh
   - Falls back to user's default lab or first available lab

## 📊 Lab Distribution

Based on current database:
- **RICCC Lab:**
  - 4 Buckets (44.4%)
  - Multiple studies and projects
  - Active team members
  
- **RHEDAS Lab:**
  - 5 Buckets (55.6%)
  - Health equity focused studies
  - Separate team roster

## 🚀 Testing the Feature

1. **Switch Between Labs:**
   - Click the lab selector in top navigation
   - Choose RICCC or RHEDAS
   - Observe that all pages update with lab-specific content

2. **Verify Filtering:**
   - Buckets page shows only buckets for selected lab
   - Studies page shows only studies for selected lab
   - Team page shows only members for selected lab
   - Dashboard shows metrics for selected lab only

3. **Persistence Check:**
   - Select a lab
   - Refresh the page
   - Lab selection should persist

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **API Performance:**
   - Some API endpoints may be slow due to Prisma Accelerate
   - Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data

2. **Initial Load:**
   - First lab fetch may take time
   - Loading states implemented but could be improved

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Add data caching
   - Implement optimistic updates
   - Consider using SWR or React Query

2. **User Experience:**
   - Add lab-specific theming/colors
   - Show lab logo in selector
   - Add keyboard shortcuts for lab switching

3. **Security:**
   - Ensure users can only see labs they have access to
   - Add role-based filtering on backend

## 🔒 Security Notes

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Before deployment, you MUST:
1. Regenerate all exposed API keys (OpenAI, Resend, Database)
2. Update environment variables in Vercel
3. Never commit secrets to git

## ✨ Summary

The lab filtering feature is now fully implemented across all major pages. Users can toggle between RICCC and RHEDAS labs, and all content (buckets, studies, ideas, team members, standups, and dashboard metrics) will update accordingly. The selection persists across sessions, providing a seamless multi-tenant experience.
