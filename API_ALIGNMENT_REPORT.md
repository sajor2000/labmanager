# API Endpoint Alignment Report

## Summary
All API endpoints have been successfully aligned between frontend and backend code.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Missing Backend Routes
âœ… **Views Management** (`/api/views/route.ts` & `/api/views/[viewId]/route.ts`)
- GET /api/views - Retrieve views for a workspace/table
- POST /api/views - Create new view
- GET /api/views/[viewId] - Get specific view
- PUT /api/views/[viewId] - Update view
- DELETE /api/views/[viewId] - Delete view

âœ… **Project Status Update** (`/api/projects/[projectId]/status/route.ts`)
- PATCH /api/projects/[projectId]/status - Update project status with permission checking

âœ… **Task Movement** (`/api/tasks/[taskId]/move/route.ts`)
- POST /api/tasks/[taskId]/move - Move tasks between projects/buckets with validation

âœ… **Client-side Logging** (`/api/logs/route.ts`)
- POST /api/logs - Receive client-side logs
- GET /api/logs - Retrieve logs (with filtering)
- DELETE /api/logs - Clear logs

### 2. Fixed DELETE Endpoint Inconsistencies
âœ… **Task Store** (`/lib/store/task-store.ts`)
- Changed from: `/api/tasks?id=${id}`
- Changed to: `/api/tasks/${id}`

âœ… **Comments Hook** (`/hooks/use-comments.ts`)
- Changed from: Query parameter `?userId=${user.id}`
- Changed to: Header `x-selected-user-id: user.id`

âœ… **Comments API** (`/app/api/comments/[id]/route.ts`)
- Updated to read userId from header instead of query parameter

## Current API Status

### âœ… Fully Aligned Endpoints (40+)
- Dashboard & Metrics
- Labs Management
- Buckets & Projects
- Studies & Tasks
- Comments System
- Calendar Events
- Deadlines
- Team Members
- Standups & Transcripts
- User Management
- Views & Filters
- Search
- Logs

### ðŸ”„ Unused Backend Routes (Could be connected in future)
- Ideas Board UI â†’ `/api/ideas` endpoints
- Calendar UI â†’ Enhanced calendar event features
- Team page â†’ Full team management features
- Global search â†’ `/api/search` endpoint

## Build Status
âœ… Production build successful
âœ… All TypeScript checks pass
âœ… No API route errors
âœ… All frontend API calls have matching backend handlers

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Wire up Ideas Board UI to backend endpoints
2. Implement global search functionality
3. Add authentication to admin endpoints (logs, etc.)
4. Connect remaining unused backend features to UI

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test CRUD operations for all resources
2. Verify permission checks on protected endpoints
3. Test error handling for invalid requests
4. Validate data transformations between frontend/backend formats
