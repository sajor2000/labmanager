# Navigation Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Sidebar Navigation (`/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`)
✅ **Fixed Navigation Links**
- Changed Overview link from "/" to "/overview" to match the actual page location
- Removed unnecessary onClick handlers that could interfere with Next.js routing
- Simplified CSS classes for better maintainability
- Removed inline styles that could cause z-index issues

### 2. Home Page Redirect (`/app/page.tsx`)
✅ **Added Automatic Redirect**
- Home page (/) now redirects to /overview automatically
- Prevents confusion and ensures users land on the correct dashboard

### 3. Layout Simplification (`/app/layout.tsx`)
✅ **Removed Potential Blocking Elements**
- Removed relative positioning that could cause overlapping issues
- Simplified the layout structure

## Navigation Test Results

All pages are accessible and return HTTP 200 status codes:

| Page | Route | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Overview | /overview | ✅ 200 |
| Labs | /labs | ✅ 200 |
| Buckets | /buckets | ✅ 200 |
| Studies | /studies | ✅ 200 |
| Stacked by Bucket | /stacked | ✅ 200 |
| Kanban Board | /kanban | ✅ 200 |
| Task Board | /tasks | ✅ 200 |
| Ideas Board | /ideas | ✅ 200 |
| Calendar | /calendar | ✅ 200 |
| Deadlines | /deadlines | ✅ 200 |
| Team Members | /team | ✅ 200 |
| Standups | /standups | ✅ 200 |

## Test Navigation Page

Created `/app/test-nav/page.tsx` for testing navigation functionality:
- Tests all routes programmatically
- Provides both Link and Router navigation methods
- Shows real-time test results
- Accessible at http://localhost:3001/test-nav

## How to Verify Navigation Works

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Click each link in the sidebar
   - Each page should load without errors
   - Active page should be highlighted in the sidebar

2. **Automated Testing**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3001/test-nav
   - Click "Run All Tests" to verify all routes
   - Use the individual "Visit" buttons to test navigation methods

## Known Working State

- All routes are accessible via direct URL
- Sidebar navigation uses Next.js Link components for proper client-side routing
- Pages load with proper content
- No console errors related to navigation
- QueryProvider is properly configured with static imports

## If Navigation Still Doesn't Work

Check for:
1. Browser console errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Any browser extensions that might block navigation
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Restart the development server with `npm run dev`

## Commands to Test

```bash
# Test all routes via curl
for route in "/overview" "/labs" "/buckets" "/studies" "/stacked" "/kanban" "/tasks" "/ideas" "/calendar" "/deadlines" "/team" "/standups"; do
  echo "Testing $route..."
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3001$route
done

# Should all return 200
```
